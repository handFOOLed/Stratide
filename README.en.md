# Stratide

A local-first, **paper-only** personal quantitative research system: Rust risk/ledger and replay, genuine EOD observation, and a local read-only Web Dashboard. Cloud research Agent development is next. **Not authorized for real-money trading; no proven trading edge.**

## Status

- **Implemented:** paper Risk Kernel, durable ledger and reports, exploratory historical EOD replay, observe-only forward EOD journal, and [Web Dashboard V1](apps/dashboard/README.md).
- **Limits:** 68 historical sessions / 3 simulated fills; longer history `DATA_BLOCKED` by corporate-action and fee evidence. Only one valid forward observation day; **no continuous forward-paper fills or account NAV**.
- **Next:** [#22 Agent implementation and APIs (Sol)](https://github.com/handFOOLed/Stratide/issues/22) → [#23 complete UI/UX redesign (DeepSeek)](https://github.com/handFOOLed/Stratide/issues/23). See [current status and evidence](docs/STATUS.md).

## Try the dashboard on Windows

From the repository root, using a **synthetic test report**:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/start-dashboard.ps1 -ReportDir 'docs/evidence/m0-pr03/sample-report'
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8710`; stop with Ctrl+C. For your own published report and other commands, see [Dashboard instructions](apps/dashboard/README.md) and [engineering roadmap](docs/PAPER_TRADING_ROADMAP.md).
